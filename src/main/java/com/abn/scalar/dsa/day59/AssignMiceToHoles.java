/*N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line. Each hole can accommodate only one mouse.
The positions of Mice are denoted by array A, and the position of holes is denoted by array B.

A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1.
Any of these moves consume 1 minute.

Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.

Input 1:

 A = [-4, 2, 3]
 B = [0, -2, 4]

 2

Input 2:

 A = [-2]
 B = [-6]
