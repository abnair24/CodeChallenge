/*
   A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the
   sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly
   in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

   Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.

   Input: 19
   Output: true
   Explanation: 1 + 81 = 82
   64 + 4 = 68
   36 + 64 = 100
   1 + 0 + 0 = 1

  Tip: If the number sum doesnt end in 1, then its sum's will follow a cycle

  Ex: 12
  1+ 4 = 5
  5* 5 = 25
  4 + 25 = 29
  4 + 81 = 85
  64 + 25 = 89
  64 + 81 = 145
  1 + 16 + 25 = 42
  16 + 4 = 20
  4 + 0 =4
  4 * 4 = 16
  1+ 36 = 37
  9 + 49 = 58
  25 + 64 = 89
