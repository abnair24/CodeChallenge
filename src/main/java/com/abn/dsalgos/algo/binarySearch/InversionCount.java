Inversion count represents how far or close an array is from being sorted.
 If an array is sorted, the inversion count is 0. But if itâ€™s sorted in the reverse order,
 the inversion count is maximum.

 (9, 5, 6, 11, 8, 10)

 Number of inversions = 5

 i-e: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8), (11, 8), (11, 10)
