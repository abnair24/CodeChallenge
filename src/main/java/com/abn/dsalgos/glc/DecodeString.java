/*
Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times.
Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
Output: "aaabcbc"

Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
Output: "accaccacc"
