/*
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the
sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until
the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly
in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this
process ends in 1 are happy numbers.


Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation:
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
